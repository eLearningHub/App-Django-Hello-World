# Django Hello World

This is a simple Django starter.

*   Run `make build` to build a Docker image.
*   Run `make run` to run a Docker container called `project-dev.`
*   Open your browser at localhost:8000 to see the main page of the Django application.
*   Run `make clean` before running `make run` again to delete the `project-dev` container.
